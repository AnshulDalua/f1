## Running Locally

```
npm run dev
```

When editing pages, edit the page within pages_, the contents of pages is automatically built to handle the various locales supported by F1 Calendar.


## Localization

F1 Calendar can now be localized. Localization files live within the locales directory. We rely on community contributions to add additional languages to the calendar. 


### Adding a new language

In the locales folder copy the "en" directory and create a new directory with the two letter code for the new locale you want to add.

Go through each of the json files and translate the English to your chosen language. Feel free to create an issue if you require more context for a string.

Once completed feel free to submit a PR, we will be happy to configure the rest of the app to make use of the new strings.
